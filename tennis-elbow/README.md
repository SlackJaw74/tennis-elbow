# Tennis Elbow Treatment App

An iOS application to help manage and track tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) recovery with structured treatment plans, scheduling, pain tracking, and progress monitoring.

## Features

- 📋 **Progressive Treatment Plans** - Three 2-week treatment phases
- 📅 **Smart Scheduling** - Automatic activity scheduling with customizable times
- 🔔 **Push Notifications** - Reminders for scheduled activities
- 📊 **Pain Tracking** - Record and visualize pain levels over time
- 📈 **Progress Analytics** - Track completion rates and treatment effectiveness
- 💡 **Educational Content** - Learn about tennis elbow and treatment best practices

## Build & Launch in iOS Simulator

These steps use the included Xcode project and the iOS Simulator.

### Command Line (fastest)

Prerequisites: Xcode installed and at least one iOS simulator (e.g., iPhone 16e) available.

```bash
# Navigate to the workspace root
cd /Users/bwils17/code/tennis-elbow

# Open Simulator (boots your last device)
open -a Simulator

# Build for the simulator (Debug)
xcodebuild \
   -project "TennisElbow/TennisElbow.xcodeproj" \
   -scheme "TennisElbow" \
   -configuration Debug \
   -sdk iphonesimulator \
   -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16e" \
   -derivedDataPath build \
   clean build

# Install the built app to the booted simulator
xcrun simctl install booted "build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/TennisElbow.app"

# Launch the app by bundle identifier
xcrun simctl launch booted com.madhouse.TennisElbow
```

Notes:

- If `iPhone 16e` isn’t available, pick another installed device name from:
   `xcrun simctl list devices` and update the `-destination`.
- The build output lives in `build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/`.

### Xcode (GUI)

1. Open the project: [TennisElbow/TennisElbow.xcodeproj](TennisElbow/TennisElbow.xcodeproj)
2. In the toolbar, select a simulator device (e.g., iPhone 16e).
3. Ensure the scheme is `TennisElbow` and configuration is `Debug`.
4. Press Run (▶) or `Cmd+R` to build and launch.

### Troubleshooting

- No simulators available: open Xcode → Settings → Platforms → install iOS simulators.
- Pick a valid device name: run `xcrun simctl list devices` and use one marked `(Shutdown)` or `(Booted)`.
- Clean derived data: remove the local `build` folder or use Xcode’s Product → Clean Build Folder.
- App doesn’t appear: re-run the install and launch steps; ensure the Simulator is booted.

## How to Test the App

### Option 1: Using Xcode (Recommended)

1. **Install Xcode** from the Mac App Store (if not already installed)

2. **Create a new Xcode project:**
   - Open Xcode
   - Select "Create a new Xcode project"
   - Choose "iOS" → "App"
   - Click "Next"
   - Fill in:
     - Product Name: `TennisElbow`
     - Team: Select your team (or leave as None for simulator only)
     - Organization Identifier: `com.yourname` (or any identifier)
     - Interface: **SwiftUI**
     - Language: **Swift**
     - Storage: **None**
   - Click "Next" and save to a temporary location

3. **Replace the project files:**
   - Delete the default `ContentView.swift` and `TennisElbowApp.swift` from Xcode
   - Drag and drop all files from this directory into your Xcode project:
     - `TennisElbowApp.swift`
     - `ContentView.swift`
     - `Models/` folder (all 3 files)
     - `ViewModels/` folder (TreatmentManager.swift)
     - `Views/` folder (all 5 files)
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
   - Select "Create groups" for folders

4. **Configure capabilities:**
   - Select your project in the navigator
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - If testing notifications, you may need to enable "Push Notifications"

5. **Run the app:**
   - Select a simulator (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro")
   - Click the Play button (▶️) or press Cmd+R
   - The app will build and launch in the simulator

### Option 2: Using Swift Playgrounds (iPad/Mac)

If you have an iPad with Swift Playgrounds:

1. Create a new App project
2. Copy the code files one by one
3. Run directly on your iPad

### Option 3: Quick Test with Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/bwils17/code/tennis-elbow

# Use xcodebuild to create and test (requires setting up project first)
# This is more advanced - use Option 1 for easier testing
```

## Testing Tips

### Initial Setup

1. **First Launch**: The app will generate a default schedule for the current week
2. **Enable Notifications**: Go to Settings tab → Enable Reminders (simulator will show permission dialog)
3. **Explore Treatment Plan**: View all activities in the Treatment tab

### Testing Activities

1. **Schedule Tab**:
   - Use the calendar to select different dates
   - Tap activities to view details
   - Mark activities as complete and select pain level

2. **Pain Tracking**:
   - Complete several activities with different pain levels
   - Go to Progress tab to see the pain chart and trends
   - Chart needs at least 2 data points to show trends

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Complete activities to see progress bars fill up
   - Check the completion percentages
   - View recent completions history

4. **Change Treatment Plans**:
   - Go to Settings → Current Plan
   - Switch between Week 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 plans
   - Notice how activities change based on recovery phase

### Simulator Tips

- **Notifications**: Won't appear as prominently in simulator as on real device
- **Time Travel**: Change simulator time (Debug → Custom Time) to test scheduling
- **Reset**: Delete app from simulator to start fresh
